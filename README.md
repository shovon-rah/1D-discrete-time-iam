# 1D Discrete-Time Lattice Model with Asymmetric Boundary

This repository contains a simple 1D discrete-time lattice simulation illustrating how an asymmetric (non-reciprocal) boundary condition can lead to density rectification.

Particles perform unbiased random hops on a one-dimensional lattice. A doorway at the origin separates two regions, with left-to-right crossings forbidden while right-to-left crossings are allowed. This rule breaks microscopic reversibility and leads to a non-equilibrium steady-state with unequal particle densities.

This is intended as a minimal toy model for exploring the effects of non-reciprocal rules in stochastic systems.
